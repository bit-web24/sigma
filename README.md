# Sigma Î£
An extreme lightweight text-editor built with `C programming language` and the `ncurses` linux library. This project is under **GPL-V3 licence** and always be open source.
Although there are many text editors available for the linux system like: Vim, Nano, Pico, etc. but their user experience is not too good.
I know everyone can master on using vim after using it for a long time. But if you are focusing on your project and don't want to learn and remmember the vim commands and key bindings but also want to stay on the command-line, then they are not too good for that purpose.

Sigma text-edior is under developement and no pre-releases are released yet, but it is going to focus on the following features.

# Features
- Alraedy known key-bindings
- Best user experience
- Highly configurable
- Responsive for different sized screens

# Build and Usage
As you know this project has no release and is under develoement. But you can build from the source using the following required packages.
- gcc
- ncurses

theses two packages are available on every distribution's user repository and can be downloaded easily.

### How to build the source code?
For now, this project is going in a single file only and therefore no configurations are required to build from the source code.

You can build the source code using the following shell command-

```bash
gcc main.c -l ncurses -o sigma
```
