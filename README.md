# Sigma Î£
An extreme lightweight text-editor built with `C programming language` and the `ncurses` linux library. This project is under **GPL-V3 licence** and always be open source.
Although there are many text editors available for the linux system like: Vim, Nano, Pico, etc. but their user experience is not too good.
I know everyone can master on using vim after using it for a long time. But if you are focusing on your project and don't want to learn and remmember the vim commands and key bindings but also want to stay on the command-line, then they are not too good for that purpose.
